        <p class="text">Im limited. Just look at me I'm limited. And just look at you, You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda. So now it's up to you. For both of us. Now it's up to you. I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason. Bringing something we must learn. And we are led to those who help us most to grow if we let them and we help them in return. Well, I don't know if I believe that's true. But I know I'm who I am today because 1 knew you. Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But because I knew you, I have been changed for good. It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime. So let me say before we part, so much of me is made of what I learned from you. You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart. And now whatever way our stories end I know you have re-written mine by being my friend. Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea. Like a seed dropped by a sky bird in a distant wood.</p>
        <p class="text">Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But because I knew you, because I knew you, <b>I have been changed for good.</b> And just to clear the air, I ask forgiveness for the things I've done you blame me for. But then, I guess we know there's blame to share. And none of it seems to matter anymore. Like a comet pulled from orbit, like a ship blown from its mooring, as it passes a sun, by a wind off the sea, like a stream that meets a boulder, like a seed dropped by a bird, halfway through the wood, in the wood. Who can say if I've been changed for the better? I do believe I have been changed for the better. And because I knew you, because 1 knew you, because I knew you, I have been changed for good.</p>
